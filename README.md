## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

Always looking for feedback, advice, and tips.

- Improvements of HTML Semantics, namely `<section>` and `<article>`.

- The biggest challenge of this project was the background image as this would be my first time adjusting a background image properly.

### Continued development

In the coming future, I will be looking towards further improving on my HTML semantics and background image positioning.
